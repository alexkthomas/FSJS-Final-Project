This is my project for the January 2018 FSJS class. It is an application to help you keep track of your calories and carbs in your meals. I built it using Node.js.

To use this application you have to have the following programs on your computer :

1. Nodejs
2. MongoDB
3. Nodemon
4. Mongoose

download Node here https://www.nodejs.org/en/download

Download MongoDB here https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community

Note I am using a mongo database on the website mlab.com. You can use mlab.com or you can install and use MongoDB on your computer.

After you have the appropriate programs installed in your terminal start MongoDB with the command 'mongod'.
Then run npm install to install the project dependencies. Then enter the command npm start.

Open a browser window open a browser and type http://localhost:3030.
Now you can eat healthy and keep track of it!
